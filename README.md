It's a simple project. This project is just a To Do list to practice JS.</br>
It's my first project where I have begun to use JS in complex decisions.

I was using Sass compiler and Live server as plugins to my VS code, so you may use the same plugins (You can see the links on these plugins below), or use your other favorite plugins or even Gulp or Webpack.
